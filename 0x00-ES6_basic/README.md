# ES6 Basics

Welcome to the ES6 Basics project! This project is designed to help you understand and practice key features of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), a major update to JavaScript that introduces several new features and improvements.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

## Tasks

### Task 0: `Const` or `Let`

- **Objective:** Modify the given functions to use `const` and `let` according to their usage.
- **Files to Modify:**
  - `0-constants.js`: Update the `taskFirst` function to use `const` and the `taskNext` function to use `let`.

#### Example

**Before:**

```
function taskFirst() {
  var task = 'I prefer const when I can.';
  return task;
}

function taskNext() {
  var combination = 'But sometimes let';
  combination += getLast();
  return combination;
}```

**After:**

``export function taskFirst() {
  const task = 'I prefer const when I can.';
  return task;
}

export function taskNext() {
  let combination = 'But sometimes let';
  combination += getLast();
  return combination;
}
```
